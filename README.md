# Password-Generator
***
Challenge-3
***
This week, we were given starter code for a password generator. The goal for this assignment was to finish the starter code given within the script.js file. The end result should be a functional password generator with a list of different prompts to allow the user to make a unique password. 
***
I first created a function that housed all of the information for generating the password 

The user can select which character types they want to use

I listed all the possible character choices that the user could add to their password

I allowed the user to select how long they want their password with a min of 8 characters and a max of 128 characters 

I created an algorithm to randomize the generated password

I added some styling to the newly created password

I added a "Copy to Clipboard" option for more user accessibility
